              I am a dedicated and versatile full stack developer with a passion
              for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. With 2
              years of professional experience, I have worked with a variety of
              technologies, including React, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB,
              Tailwind, and Firebase. My journey in web development began with
              a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a
              career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new
              challenges.
